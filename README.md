# pure-python-DNA-tools
Since Python is a very popular programming laguage in nearly all file of sicence (not only CS), for its code readibility!
I found that it is helpful to create some small python script to mataince the Next Generation sequencing data (.i.e fastq, fasta, vcf etc.)

These tools will not replace these exisit popular Bioimfomatics tools, such as biopython, pysam .etc.
