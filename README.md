Python is a very popular programming language in nearly all field of science (not only CS), for its code readability!

I found that it is helpful to create some small python script to maintenance the Next Generation sequencing data (i.e. fastq, fasta, vcf etc.)  

These tools will not replace these exist popular Bioinfomatics tools, such as biopython, pysam .etc.
